<h1>
    Welcome! I read and often form opinions but rarely find the right words nor the desire to create actual critcisims and reviews, and yet still possess the urge to express my views onto anyone willing to listen; the result is this website, acturately titled "bad book reveiws," where I review books badly :)

    <p>  Disclaimer: my opinion is just that; my opinon. I am in no way an expert, and my reviews are meant to be taken lightly. Please don't be offended if I insult your fav, as I am more often than not, wrong. </p>
