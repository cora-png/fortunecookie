<h2>
    bad book reviews!
</h2>

<h1>
    Welcome! I read and often form opinions but rarely find the right words nor the want to create actual critcisims and reviews, and yet have th urge to express my views onto anyone willing to listen; the result is this website, acturately titled "bad book reveiws," where I review books badly.
