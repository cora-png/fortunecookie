                Two-second summary: Neverfell is born into a world where everyone’s face is frozen, showing no emotion, and capable of hiding even the darkest secrets. Well, everyone except Neverfell. Forced to wear a mask to hide her shockingly expressive face, Neverfell navigates a treacherous world full of wonders from magical wines to enchanted cheeses with hopes to uncover the mysteries of her past.

                Incredible world-building, not to mention they have cheeses that can get you high; a win in my book. The characters are a bit bland, but the plot and the setting spice things up. I’d suggest it to any fantasy-lover, as it finds a way to explore darker fantasy without being… haunting? Dark in comparison to the more light-hearted fantasy like Rick Riordan’s books, or other books for middle schoolers, but also lets you avoid the need to go binge four seasons of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic to cleanse your mind of the horrors you might find in City of Bones for example. It’s complex without being overly confusing, and fascinating without scarring you.

                Two-second summary: Neverfell is born into a world where everyone’s face is frozen, showing no emotion, and capable of hiding even the darkest secrets. Well, everyone except Neverfell. Forced to wear a mask to hide her shockingly expressive face, Neverfell navigates a treacherous world full of wonders from magical wines to enchanted cheeses with hopes to uncover the mysteries of her past.

                Incredible world-building, not to mention they have cheeses that can get you high; a win in my book. The characters are a bit bland, but the plot and the setting spice things up. I’d suggest it to any fantasy-lover, as it finds a way to explore darker fantasy without being… haunting? Dark in comparison to the more light-hearted fantasy like Rick Riordan’s books, or other books for middle schoolers, but also lets you avoid the need to go binge four seasons of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic to cleanse your mind of the horrors you might find in City of Bones for example. It’s complex without being overly confusing, and fascinating without scarring you.

                Two-second summary: Neverfell is born into a world where everyone’s face is frozen, showing no emotion, and capable of hiding even the darkest secrets. Well, everyone except Neverfell. Forced to wear a mask to hide her shockingly expressive face, Neverfell navigates a treacherous world full of wonders from magical wines to enchanted cheeses with hopes to uncover the mysteries of her past.

                Incredible world-building, not to mention they have cheeses that can get you high; a win in my book. The characters are a bit bland, but the plot and the setting spice things up. I’d suggest it to any fantasy-lover, as it finds a way to explore darker fantasy without being… haunting? Dark in comparison to the more light-hearted fantasy like Rick Riordan’s books, or other books for middle schoolers, but also lets you avoid the need to go binge four seasons of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic to cleanse your mind of the horrors you might find in City of Bones for example. It’s complex without being overly confusing, and fascinating without scarring you.
