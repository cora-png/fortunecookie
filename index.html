Well, everyone except Neverfell. Forced to wear a mask to hide her shockingly expressive face, Neverfell navigates a treacherous world full of wonders from magical wines to enchanted cheeses with hopes to uncover the mysteries of her past.

                    Incredible world-building, not to mention they have cheeses that can get you high; a win in my book. The characters are a bit bland, but the plot and the setting spice things up. I’d suggest it to any fantasy-lover, as it finds a way to explore darker fantasy without being… haunting? Dark in comparison to the more light-hearted fantasy like Rick Riordan’s books, or other books for middle schoolers, but also lets you avoid the need to go binge four seasons of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic to cleanse your mind of the horrors you might find in City of Bones for example. It’s complex without being overly confusing, fascinating without scarring you, and able to excite the imagination of even the most boring of readers.

                    This book hits you where it hurts. Death narrates the beginning and parts throughout the story, which should tell you something about its content. It’s uncommonly riveting, to say the least. I picked it up and really, really didn’t want to put it down because of how invested in the characters you become. Full of colorful characters and memorable story-telling, and accompanied by the feeling of inevitable dread the artfully placed foreshadowing omits, it makes for a great read even to those opposed to historical fiction.

                Two-second summary: Scarlett is the daughter of a high-ranking official on an ugly island she can’t wait to leave, and two invites to the legendary magic-filled festival called Caraval is the perfect escape. Only, Scarlett’s wedding is less than a week away, and her sister is kidnapped upon arriving at the mysterious contest. After realizing she has to win Caraval to save her beloved sister, Scarlett embarks on an adventure full of deception and fantasies with the help of a conveniently attractive stranger. Will she be able to find her sister and get home in time???

                <p class="reviewtext">
                    Okay, this book seems great on paper (pun intended) but in execution it’s average. I appreciate the concept, and I think the idea of Caraval is very cool and very aEstHetiC, but the writing and plot leave much to be desired. Off the bat, Scarlett is bland, and the descriptions of her clothes are more memorable than her. Secondly, the romance subplot is predictable and boring. Third of all, the story goes to hot garbage in the last five chapters. I have never seen a book so successfully undo the entirety of the book so far in ten paragraphs. It leaves a feeling of being right back where you started with no closure, and the characters you’ve been with since the beginning feel like complete strangers. I wouldn’t say it’s a waste of time… but it’s a waste of time. It’s a great time-filler or airport book, but I will definitely forget it’s existence in a few months.

                Two-second summary: Cinder is a cyborg living in the Commonwealth, working as a mechanic and living with her foster-mother. But after tragedy strikes when her beloved younger sister dies of the plague, Cinder is cast out into a world of lost royalty, wanted outlaws, and dark secrets. Who is Cinder really?

                    This is a fun book. The plot is somewhat predictable but still very entertaining, and I mean cOME ON, cyborg Cinderella? You’d be lying if you said that didn’t interest you in the slightest. The characters are likable and they feel like real individuals, rather than two-dimensional apparitions. Cinder is a great book but the real treasure lies in the rest of the series, where one by one, the vibrant cast of characters is introduced and the mystery continues to unfold. The genre leans more towards sci-fi than fantasy, but I’m not mad about it. Cinder’s got something for everybody, the token hot prince? You got it. Terrifying plague not unlike our predicament today? You’ve got it. Human-wolf genetically altered mutants? I dunno who asked but YOU GOT IT. It’s a wild ride but I enjoyed every second.

                    I don’t know what to tell you except I read four 500 page books of this series and I remember maybe 13% of what happened. The storyline does get pretty dark if you’re squeamish about demons and dark magic, but that’s not the part that haunts me at night. Throughout the first three books, the romance subplot between the two main characters walks the line of  “is it or is it not incest?” which is somewhere I do NOT like to be. Even after that whole mess is sorted out, the energy is so vaguely sexual and strange that the demon babies will be the least of your worries. I admit there is a time and place for The Mortal Instruments series, as it’s entertaining and a very good series for people who like supernatural fantasy, but it’s not something I particularly enjoy.

                    This book made me angry but in a good way. Holly Black played with my emotions and I thanked her. The Cruel Prince is a very well written book; the plot is gripping, the characters interesting, and conflict able to bring out your innermost rage. Wrought with betrayal and shocking discoveries, this book does plot twists well, something not common in YA novels. The entire book just radiates feelings of decadence and lavish colors; it’s perfectly fantastical.

                    I liked this book, and it’s definitely because of the characters. Don’t be alarmed by the somewhat threatening title, it’s quite a fun book. The concept is interesting, to say the least, and the plot and conflict only grow in intensity throughout the series. And the cast of characters are all very lovable. That being said it is above all a fast-paced dystopian novel, with twists and turns and secret government conspiracies. Overall a great series, just don’t watch the movie.

Amidst cunning politicians, wicked royalty, and betrayal at every turn, Nemesis also faces a dichotomy within herself; is she capable of love?

                    I picked this up from the book store on a whim, and I got so much more than I was prepared for. The first book in the series is pretty entertaining, but the story takes a completely different route towards the end and even more so in the second book. I like it, with the whole Intergalactic Court and strange religious-cult themes that evolve as you uncover the reality of this extraordinary Empire full of facades, but it’s not something you read to make you feel good. It’s more of a book that leaves you questioning for hours about how everything could’ve been avoided, or what you would do differently and if it would even matter in the endgame because everything was so doomed from the start. I can’t say much without spoiling, but you really just sit there watching everything simultaneously unravel and become more and more twisted before your eyes. It’s a slow burn toward absolute chaos that’s terrible and yet you can stop watching, kinda like watching your house burn down in the Sims. It’s interesting, to put it mildly.

                    Dude this book made me cry. Hard. At first glance, the book seems not that interesting and maybe even boring, but I swear it’s some of the most accurate and realistic character development and arcs I’ve ever seen. It’s a truly beautiful story and the emotion is almost palpable. Plus it captures the... internet culture? Whatever you call it, you know what I mean. Webcomics and cosplay are becoming increasingly popular, and there’s a whole community that was cool to see translated in a book. This story is so impactful not only because of how well written and lovable the characters and the book is, but because it is one of the most accurate portrayals of a teen’s struggles, ever. I’ve done a shoddy job of describing this book, but the conflict is so compelling; you will not regret reading this.

                    Admittedly, this book is slow. But I guarantee it is worth it to get through this one because things pick up in the second book, and by the time you get to the third you will not be able to stop until you finish the series. The Fablehaven series is targeted to the younger readers of YA fiction, but man I would gladly re-read it any day for the magical traditional fairytale fantasy world. Although I wish Kendra’s character arc didn’t rest so heavily on her being “special” and “chosen” and uh, “not like other girls,” I still like the characters. Both Seth and Kendra are believable as kids and don’t feel as much of “teen characters written by old men who haven’t been teens since the 80s” as some do *cough cough Micheal Vey,* and it was cool to watch them grow up throughout the series. Even though this book lacks the emotional drama of the romance plots in other YA books, it most definitely makes up for it with a gripping conflict and amazing world-building.

                Starr Carter has two different versions of herself: the polite and unassuming Starr that goes to Williamson Private High School, and the Starr of Garden Heights Neighborhood, though she feels out of place in either facade. But when Starr becomes the only witness to a police officer fatally shooting her childhood friend during a traffic stop, she must come to terms with her identity and find her true voice. With the Black Lives Matter movement’s recent strides and the calls for extreme law enforcement reform, the messages this book brings are more important than ever.

                    Guys just shut up and read this book. It really doesn’t matter if you like realistic fiction or not, because this story is more than fiction. This book is, unfortunately, the true story of hundreds of victims of police brutality and their families, something we can no longer sit by and ignore. Angie Thomas does a beautiful job of crafting this story full of passion and important insight into racism in today’s society. This book is a page-turner for sure, but it’s so much more than that, I’d recommend it to anyone and everyone.

                    Marissa Meyer takes a story of which you already know the ending, and somehow manages to have you desperately rooting for the unlikely heroes and leave you shocked and crushed when the inevitable comes to pass. The character arc of the main character Catherine is truly a tragic work of art. I could feel Catherine’s every emotion resonate within me and the story left me absolutely heartbroken. It’s almost torturous, watching Cath slowly resign to the darkest parts of her psyche, and seeing this girl full of ambition and hope morph into the murderous cold-blooded Queen you find in ‘Alice in Wonderland.’ As much pain as this book caused me, I would recommend it 100%. The fantastical creatures and characters of Wonderland are brought to life and the star-crossed love story brings a feeling of whimsy that is truly wonderful.

                Two-second summary: The companion series to The Selection, this book follows the story of Princess Eadlyn as she is at the center of her own Selection, where the kingdom’s young eligible bachelors participate in a long selection process in which the Princess will choose a Prince consort. Thoroughly opposed to the idea, Eadlyn has to go through the ceremony for the sake of her country, but maybe a happy ever after might not be as impossible as Eadlyn always thought.

                    This is the ‘The Little Mermaid’ sequel of books: exceptionally worse than the precursor, and utterly unnecessary. Although it does have the best cover of the series, devoid of all the urgency and driving force of the dystopian elements in the first three Selection books, this continuation is left a glorified royal Bachelor fanfiction. Eadlyn is annoying right off the bat, and though there’s some character development, her arc is shallow at best. It’s an okay book and entertaining, I guess, but it’s a meek imitation of the concept and conflict the previous books had.

                Two-second summary: 1942 Seattle is a bad place to be Asian. Forced to wear a “I am Chinese” button for safety, twelve-year-old Henry knows that people don’t like Japanese people. And when his brand new classmate and kitchen-duty partner, Keiko, becomes his only friend at school, things become more complicated. But when Keiko is whisked away to Camp Harmony, along with thousands of other Japanese-Americans, Henry is pressured to forget his friend and cut ties with anyone who could be seen as less than patriotic. This story, told from two sides, is one of the pain and trauma caused by the Japanese Internment, and of friendship and loyal even in the hardest of times.

                    One of the best books I’ve ever read, hands down. This story is so stunning, it’s art. And it hurts, oh does it hurt. It’s so bittersweet it’s painful. It only becomes more powerful when you realize that this happened here; Camp Harmony was where the Washington State Fair is today. Something that’s such a big part of Seattle’s past, an injustice not talked about nearly enough, this book is a look into history. The story-telling and character development is unmatched, and all together breathtaking.

                    There’s a reason that this series is so popular. It’s a very well written and developed dystopian novel, and I’m just gonna to say it, it deserves the hype. The concept is riveting though slightly twisted, and the writing and plot are marvellous. Suzanne Collins also managed to follow up the brilliance of the first book with two others, equally packed with heart-racing action and dramatically dangerous politics. The characters vary from terrifying to delightful and everything in between, and the conflict is just as diverse. And can I just say that the “mutts” are one of my favorite plot devices from any book, because they were so terrifying and fascinating, and just a tremendous addition to the complexity of the twisted Capitol. An amazing example of good dystopian fiction.

It’s an interesting concept, but it was a little slow, and hopefully it will probably pick up the pace in the later books. Just wasn’t something for me. John was ehhhhh, boring, and Sarah reminds me heavily of Taylor from ‘Michael Vey’ which is not a good thing. I’ll get back to it, eventually.

                    It’s the perfect sci-fi combo of zombies, evil A.I., vicious blob monsters, and wicked corporations. Each book in the series follows a different couple as they narrate the experience from their POV, pieced together through a combination of security footage descriptions, journal entries, online messages, and case files. It’s so unique and engrossing, I was able to overlook the killer leeches. The various conflicts are compulsive and so awesome and slightly gross, but combined with the smashing and delightful cast of characters make for one of the my personal favorite series ever.

Not to mention I actually like Zoya in this book. They even put in my girl Nina, even though I kinda hate her in this series. All character differences aside, the plot in this book is very compelling, and super mysterious. It explores the impacts of jurda parem that we didn’t get to see in the previous Grishaverse book that I think are so fascinating. Looking forward to the second installment later this year.

I’d suggest it to any fantasy-lover, as it finds a way to explore darker fantasy without being… haunting? Dark in comparison to the more light-hearted fantasy like Rick Riordan’s books, or other books for middle schoolers, but also lets you avoid the need to go binge four seasons of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic to cleanse your mind of the horrors you might find in City of Bones for example. It’s complex without being overly confusing, and fascinating without scarring you.

                    Unfortunately, this series is an example of meh YA dystopian fiction. The first book is pretty cool, and I thought the society was actually really intriguing, but the second and third books really just go downhill from there. The concepts and ideas of Ally Condie’s “Society” are very fascinating and are unique in a growing plethora of YA dystopian novels, but that’s about all the good I can say. Once the allure of the “Matching” concept fades, you’re really just left with a lowkey boring romance plot, and a slightly confusing and rather dull attempt at “bad government controlling people, must rebel” conflict. Not one of my favorites.

                    I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed. No, actually I am very mad. I loved this series, everything from the concept to the characters are marvellous, and the second and third books are able to replicate the same urgency and stress-inducing conflict as the first, while still exploring new topics and furthering the plot. The first book was enthralling, reminiscent of “Lord of the Flies” and the myth of the Minotaur, and the characters are downright lovable. The sequel is equal in quality, though exponentially more stressful. And even the last book was good, until James Dashner doled out my least favorite book ending OF ALL TIME (Caraval is a close second). Honestly! And it doesn’t help that this series also harbors my least favorite romance storyline, because this series did Theresa sO DIRTY and I will never not be salty over that. I try to refrain from spoilers as best I can, so all I will say is that the end of the series was the equivalent of the ending of Will Smith’s “I Am Legend”: they both leave you with an overwhelming feeling of “I sat through all this trauma for THAT?” Also the prequels are utterly useless.

The story brings you across the world, and through adventures so exciting, I’d call them almost… electrifying. Sorry. The downfall of Michael Vey is the characters. Unfortunately this series contains some of the most ridiculous teen personas I’ve ever read. I’ve seen SNL sketches that are more accurate than this. They talk like they’re reading off a CBS teen show script, and the female characters are boringly passive. Other than that, I loved this series; the antagonists and conflict are interesting, and the plot continuously keeps you reeled in. Although the series does run into a period of two books where the situation is very downcast, mainly because the heroes are really just Going Through It™, but the last book picks things back up, and the finale is consistent with the quality of the previous books.

                Two-second summary: Ophelia would much rather spend her days surrounded by artifacts and books in her beloved little museum than anywhere else, but everything is interrupted when she becomes engaged to Mr. Thorn, a high ranking official from another ark. Forced to leave her peaceful home on Anima to join her fiancé, Ophelia must navigate her way through the treacherous political climate of the Pole, wrought with scheming aristocrats and deceitful illusions.

                    This book has easily become my latest obsession, and an instant favorite. Everything about this book is so whimsical and charming, from the unmatched world-building and tasteful conflict, to the contrasting characters and the intriguing mystery. Ophelia has become quite possibly my favorite character ever, because she’s so steadfast and willing to stand up for herself even though she’s also described as quiet and small. Not to mention the marvellous complexity of the other characters, honorable mentions being Thorn and Fox. The second book is just as excellent, but somehow even more fascinating and mysterious. And the cover is darn right gorgeous; I don’t care what anyone says, the book cover makes a difference.

                Two-second summary: In a world where humans do not all bleed the same color, those born with red blood are treated as second-class citizens as those who bleed sliver rule as royalty with supernatural powers. But when Mare Barrow publicly discovers she has similar special abilities even though her blood is red, in an effort to save face and retain his power, the king disguises her as a long-lost Silver princess. Suddenly engaged to the royalty she despises, and wrapped up in a world among deadly nobility and untrustworthy but handsome princes, Mare cannot make one wrong move, as it could cost her life.

                    Similarly to ‘Matched,’ the premise of the book is captivating, and I’d even go to say the first book was splendid, but once the original appeal of the concept fades as the plot moves past that point, it all runs downhill. Yet another example of the sequels not being able to carry the allure and conflict the first book boasts. Additionally, Mare is unremarkable as a character, which you really don’t realize until the later books, but becomes painfully obvious. And she ends up with the prince I liked the least. Unfortunate, but still worth reading for those who dig the supernatural royal dystopian vibe.

                    Very fun twist on the traditional superhero story, and the superpowers are really cool and unique. I like the protagonist also being one of the antagonists, it makes for a very interesting conflict. Unfortunately, this series never clicked with me the way the rest of Marissa Meyer’s other books did. I can’t think of anything outstandingly bad about it, but maybe superheroes aren’t my thing.

But when America is selected after entering the contest on a whim, it’s her worst nightmare. Forced to leave her family and home, along with her childhood friend and sweetheart, America is shipped off to be a prince’s plaything. Absorbed into a scathing competition brimming with jealous girls, corrupt government, and love triangles, America must make a choice between a life she’d always dreamed of, and a future she never could’ve imagined.

                    For a book that seems so frou frou, there is a startling amount of heads blown off for a princess novel. I was drawn to the book because of the princess competition, but stayed for the corrupt government and political scheming (unrelated but important: what is it with YA novels and the abundance of “competition to win the heart of some unseasoned prince” storylines? Like pack it up ‘The Bachelor’ contestants). Admittedly, America gets on my nerves sometimes, but it wasn’t destructive to the experience. I especially liked the idea of the caste system, which boosted the whole dystopian feel. I have mixed feelings about the ending, but it did what needed to be done, albeit a little rushed. All in all, it’s a dystopian literary Bachelor, do with that what you will.

                    Chances are you’ve already heard of this series, and I promise you it is every bit cheesy and unrealistic as promised. Of course this is among the plethora of “jock boy falls for nerdy girl” cheesy romance novels out there, but it is fun. Normally I detest clichés of all kinds, but this series is absolutely addicting, not to mention the movie is adorable (the sequel sucks though). Overflowing with highschool drama and the twists and turns you’d want in a book with such a concept. And the second book does not disappoint. Much better than the movie, the sequel is also full of drama and emotion. Needless to say, I like this series, sue me.

The idea of Warcross is so intriguing, especially with augmented and virtual reality becoming more widely available; ‘Warcross’ could be the world in a decade. Emika is a cool character, but the romance plot is straight out of Wattpad. Thankfully, romance is not the main storyline, and the competition parts are so captivating and fun that I’ll let Marie Lu get away with it this time. Anyway, read Warcross.
